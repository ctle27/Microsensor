File1: Base-pairing probability analysis
Level of miRNAs in HEK293T-WT, HEK293T-DGCR8-KO and HEK293T-DGCR8-E518K was obtained from small RNA sequencing.
The level of a pri-miRNA is the the sum of its 3p and 5p miRNA level.
The list of most and least affected pri-miRNAs were obtained and the base-pairing probability at each position on the pri-miRNA sequence was obtained from RNAfold (RNAfold -p).

File2, 3: Z-score and GO set enrichment analysis for mRNA sequencing data
Raw count of each mRNA was obtained from mRNA sequencing data.
The level of each mRNA in a sample was normalized to the level of GAPDH.
Z-score and GO set enrichment analysis were analysed in File 2 and 3, respectively.
